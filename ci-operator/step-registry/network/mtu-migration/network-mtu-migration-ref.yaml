    The step sets an MTU migration procedure configuration. Reads MTU_OFFSET
    variable from ${SHARED_DIR}/mtu-migration-config. If it is a positive value,
    it will configure a increase MTU migration by that offset. Likewise if it is
    negative value, but for a decrease MTU migration. If MTU_OFFSET is 0, it
    will end an existing MTU migration procedure by removing the MTU migration
    configuration and applying the final MTU.
